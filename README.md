# mk2-msu-md
MK2-MSU-MD Is a chunk of code that can be compiled down and applied to the original release of mortal kombat 2 on the sega genesis.
The additional code adds the aracde music soundtrack via the sega-cd. This is still very much an early release and not completed.
Please feel free to help!

# How to build
Simply run the patch.sh shell script. This is setup to call wine on a linux system which will run the .exe file asm68k.exe
You can alternatively patch the rom using dosbox to run the .exe file as well.
